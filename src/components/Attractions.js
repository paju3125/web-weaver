                                The Meenkulathi Temple is located in Pallassana, a village in southern India.

                                Meenkulathikkavu is the oldest temple in Pallassena. Tradition has it that centuries ago three families belonging to the Veerasaiva Mannadiar clan worshipped the goddess Meenakshi as their deity.

                                The structure is built in the Kerala style. It is constructed in such a way that the shadow of the wall never falls on the ground. There are two entrances, one in the north and the other in the west. The temple tank is next to the western entrance.
